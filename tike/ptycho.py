"""Solve the phase-retrieval problem.

Coordinate Systems
==================
`v, h` are the horizontal and vertical directions perpendicular
to the probe direction where positive directions are to the right and up.

Functions
=========
Each function in this module should have the following interface:

Parameters
----------
data : (M, V, H) :py:class:`numpy.array` float
    An array of detector intensities for each of the `M` probes. The
    grid of each detector is `H` pixels wide (the horizontal
    direction) and `V` pixels tall (the vertical direction).
probe : (V, H) :py:class:`numpy.array` complex
    The single illumination function of the `M` probes.
psi : (T, V, H) :py:class:`numpy.array` complex
    The object transmission function for each of the `T` views.
foo_corner : (2, ) float [p]
    The min corner (v, h) of `foo` in the global coordinate system. `foo`
    could be `data`, `psi`, etc.
kwargs
    Keyword arguments specific to this function. `**kwargs` should always be
    included so that extra parameters are ignored instead of raising an error.
