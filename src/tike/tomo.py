"""Define functions for solving the tomography problem.

Coordinate Systems
==================
`theta, v, h`. `v, h` are the horizontal vertical directions perpendicular
to the probe direction where positive directions are to the right and up.
`theta` is the rotation angle around the vertical reconstruction
space axis, `z`. `z` is parallel to `v`, and uses the right hand rule to
determine reconstruction space coordinates `z, x, y`. `theta` is measured
from the `x` axis, so when `theta = 0`, `h` is parallel to `y`.

Functions
=========
Each public function in this module should have the following interface:

Parameters
----------
obj : (Z, X, Y, P) :py:class:`numpy.array` float
    An array of material properties. The first three dimensions `Z, X, Y`
    are spatial dimensions. The fourth dimension, `P`,  holds properties at
    each grid position: refractive indices, attenuation coefficents, etc.

        * (..., 0) : delta, the real phase velocity, the decrement of the
            refractive index.
        * (..., 1) : beta, the imaginary amplitude extinction / absorption
            coefficient.

obj_corner : (3, ) float
    The min corner (z, x, y) of the `obj`.
line_integrals : (M, V, H, P) :py:class:`numpy.array` float
    Integrals across the `obj` for each of the `probe` rays and
    P parameters.
probe : (V, H, P) :py:class:`numpy.array` float
    The initial parameters of the probe to be projected across
    the `obj`. The grid of each probe is `H` rays wide (the
    horizontal direction) and `V` rays tall (the vertical direction). The
    fourth dimension, `P`, holds parameters at each grid position:
    real and imaginary wave components
theta, v, h : (M, ) :py:class:`numpy.array` float
    The min corner (theta, v, h) of the `probe` for each measurement.
kwargs
    Keyword arguments specific to this function. `**kwargs` should always be
    included so that extra parameters are ignored instead of raising an error.
