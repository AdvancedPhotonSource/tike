"""Functions related to creating and manipulating probe arrays.

Ptychographic probes are represented as two separate components: a shared probe
whose values are the same for all positions and the varying component. The
former is required as it provides the shared probe constraint for ptychography
and the later relaxes the former constraint to accomodate real-world
illuminations which may vary with time.

The shared component consist of a single array representing at least one probe
each of which may have an accompanying varying component.

The varying components are stored sparsely as two arrays, and the full
representation of the varying comonents are only combined as needed. The first
array is an array of eigen probes (principal components) spanning the space of
the probe variation of all positions and the second is an array of weights that
map the variation for each position into this space.

Each probe may have its own set of eigen probes. The unique probe at a given
position is reconstructed by adding the shared probe to a weighted sum of the
eigen probes.

.. code-block:: python

    varying_probe = weights[0] * probe + np.sum(weights[1:] * eigen_probes)


Design comments
---------------
In theory, the probe representation could be implemented in as little as two
arrays: one with all of the shared components where the probe becomes the first
eigen probe and and one with the weights. Choosing to keep the eigen probes
separate from the probe as a third array provides backwards compatability and
allows for storing fewer eigen probes in the case when only some probes are
allowed to vary.
