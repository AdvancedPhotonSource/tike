class Convolution(Operator):
    """A 2D Convolution operator with linear interpolation.

    Compute the product two arrays at specific relative positions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    nscan : int
        The number of scan positions at each angular view.
    fly : int
        The number of consecutive scan positions that describe a fly scan.
    nmode : int
        The number of probe modes per scan position.
    probe_shape : int
        The pixel width and height of the (square) probe illumination.
    nz, n : int
        The pixel width and height of the reconstructed grid.
    ntheta : int
        The number of angular partitions of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psi : (ntheta, nz, n) complex64
        The complex wavefront modulation of the object.
    probe : complex64
        The (ntheta, nscan // fly, fly, nmode, probe_shape, probe_shape)
        complex illumination function.
    nearplane: complex64
        The (ntheta, nscan // fly, fly, nmode, probe_shape, probe_shape)
        wavefronts after exiting the object.
    scan : (ntheta, nscan, 2) float32
        Coordinates of the minimum corner of the probe grid for each
        measurement in the coordinate system of psi. Vertical coordinates
        first, horizontal coordinates second.
