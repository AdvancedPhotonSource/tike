Key Concepts
************
The key concepts of the Tike code structure are the following:

 1. Solvers are based on forward and adjoint operators

 2. Solvers are organized into modules based on problem-type


Solvers share fundamental operators
===================================
An operator is a transforms data from one space to another. For example, the
tomography forward operator is the radon transform; it maps a 2D Cartesian space
to the sinogram space. The adjoint operator maps data from sinogram space back
to 2D Cartesian. All iterative solvers of a problem use forward and adjoint, so
we avoid code duplication by implementing all solvers in terms of forward and
adjoint operators to reduce code duplication to make future-upgrades easier.


Modules by problem type
=======================
The solvers for each problem-type (ptychography, tomography, etc) are separated
into modules of their respective names.
